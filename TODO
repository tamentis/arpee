 - Keep implementing opcodes.

 - Find out if we should really increment the program counter after JMP. That
   seems crazy but games like Turtles seems to be thrown in an infinite loop
   (BIOS JMPs at 0x400h, then the game at 0x400h also JMPs at 0x400h).

 - Import PyGame in the mix and come up with an interface for the GPU/VDC to
   throw pixels at it.

 - Read the joysticks.

 - Create the default sprites from scratch.
